# Project 18 Forkify Additional Features!

## Description

Added additional features to Forkify. This application allows users to search through the Forkify API in order to find and display food recipe data. Searched recipes may also be added to a bookmarked list, which the user can also click from this bookmarked list to display the respective recipe. Furthermore, user is able to create their own recipes, which will be automatically bookmarked and saved to the local API so that the user can reload the page and still see all of their bookmarked recipes.

## Scenarios

- Search for any recipe that's from the Forkify API
